### Overview
* This repository includes the components for Mini-Project 3 - Polars Descriptive Statistics Script
Requirements.

### Goal
* It transforms my previous project with Pandas into generating descriptive statistics using Polars.
* It contains a series of EDA on a dataset related to the development of average annual wages across various countries in the world.
* The EDA process includes getting essential statistics such as **mean**, **median**, and **standard deviation**, as well as a quick data visualization on the **growth of the average annual wages**.
* The summary statistics and data visualization can be found in the **Summary Report** notebook file
* This repo also contains respective **tests** to check whether the statistics calculated in the EDA process **match with the real data points**.

### Key elements in the repository are:
* Development of average annual wages.csv
* Summary Report.ipynb
* Makefile
* requirements.txt
* Dockerfile
* devcontainer
* main.py
* test_main.py
* GitHub Actions

### Results
Using Github Actions, I have passed make format, make lint, and make test as shown below.
